# CoreVideo

> **ZOOM RAW DATA AND BANDWIDTH LIMITS - READ BEFORE USE**
>
> CoreVideo uses the Zoom Meeting SDK raw data APIs. Raw data access is available
> through Meeting SDK apps; negotiated quality follows the signed-in Zoom account
> and app entitlements. Standard accounts are typically constrained by a 30 Mbps
> incoming video budget, while Enhanced Media / HBM can raise that envelope to
> roughly 100 Mbps. At about 4-6 Mbps per standard 1080p stream, several feeds
> can work without EM; with EM/HBM, plan around up to 16 standard 1080p feeds or
> about 8 high-bitrate/60 fps feeds before hitting the downlink budget.

**OBS Studio plugin for live Zoom meeting video, audio, screen share, and Zoom interpretation audio channel capture.**

CoreVideo integrates the Zoom Meeting SDK into OBS - no screen capture or virtual camera required. The SDK runs in a dedicated `ZoomObsEngine` child process; the OBS plugin communicates with it through a `ZoomEngineClient` singleton over cross-platform IPC (named pipes on Windows, Unix sockets on macOS/Linux) with frame data delivered through named shared memory. A built-in dockable control panel manages joining, and a `ZoomReconnectManager` handles automatic recovery after crashes or disconnects.

## Features

- **Raw video capture** - I420 YUV, selectable 360p / 720p / 1080p resolution
- **Hardware-accelerated video** - optional FFmpeg I420->NV12 conversion via CUDA, VAAPI, VideoToolbox, or QSV (`-DCOREVIDEO_HW_ACCEL=ON`)
- **Video loss mode** - hold last frame or show black when a feed drops; shows color-bar placeholder before first frame
- **Raw audio capture** - 48 kHz PCM, mono or stereo, with per-participant audio isolation and mixer routing
- **Auto ISO recording** - record assigned participant/active-speaker/spotlight outputs to separate FFmpeg-encoded MP4 files with matching PCM WAV audio, plus optional main OBS program recording
- **Assignment modes** - each source independently follows: a fixed participant, the active speaker, a ZoomISO-style spotlight slot (1...N), or the active screen share
- **Failover participant** - configure a secondary participant that activates automatically when the primary leaves
- **Active Speaker Director** - configurable sensitivity + hold-time switching, manual take/release supersede, and a dedicated `CoreVideo Active Speaker` OBS source for clean speaker-follow output
- **Spotlight / ZoomISO** - subscribe a source to spotlight slot N; engine resolves which participant is spotlighted
- **Screen share capture** - source subscribes to the active meeting screen-share feed
- **Zoom interpretation audio channel capture** - dedicated OBS source for existing Zoom interpretation audio channels
- **Per-participant audio sources** - standalone OBS audio source per meeting participant
- **Webinar support** - join Zoom Webinars using the dedicated SDK entry point (Webinar checkbox in control dock)
- **Participant roster** - live list with video, mute, talking, host, co-host, raised hand, spotlight slot, and screen-sharing state
- **Control dock** - dockable Qt panel with animated status dot, join/leave, token-type selector, recovery countdown, Active Speaker Director controls, and a routing section that opens the dedicated Output Manager; persists last meeting ID and display name across sessions
- **Diagnostics dock** - dockable OBS panel showing requested vs observed resolution, FPS, frame age, retry counts, recent engine debug events, and a redacted support-bundle export for live troubleshooting
- **Auto-reconnect** - exponential back-off recovery after engine crash, network drop, or unexpected disconnect
- **OBS hotkeys** - per-source hotkeys to enable/disable active speaker mode
- **TCP control API** - JSON server on `127.0.0.1:19870` for scripts and dashboards; includes `oauth_callback` command for custom URL scheme forwarding
- **OSC control API** - UDP OSC server on `127.0.0.1:19871` for lighting consoles and broadcast hardware
- **Output profiles** - save and load named participant-to-source mappings as JSON files
- **Output manager dock** - dockable OBS panel and API for viewing and reconfiguring all sources at runtime
- **Public Client Meeting SDK authentication** - published builds pass the Marketplace Public Client ID as `AuthContext.publicAppKey`; no Meeting SDK secret is shipped in the desktop app
- **Zoom OAuth PKCE** - user-level OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (public client, no desktop secret) for attributed joins and Marketplace compliance; the broker start URL is baked in at build time; `corevideo://` custom URL scheme with platform callback helpers (`CoreVideoOAuthCallback.exe` / `.app`); DPAPI token protection on Windows
- **Visible Zoom Meeting SDK window** - the helper process uses Zoom's default Meeting SDK UI so operators can admit waiting-room participants, start self video/audio, and use normal in-meeting controls while OBS receives raw feeds
- **SDK 5.17.x and 7.x** - auto-detects flat and subfolder header layouts
- **Hardened security** - constant-time token comparison, validated IPC input, sanitised participant IDs, SIGPIPE handling
- **Modern UI** - CoreVideo stylesheet with dark theme, animated `CvStatusDot`, `CvBanner` first-run notices, and button role variants (primary / danger)
- **Multi-platform** - Windows (x64/arm64), macOS (universal arm64 + x86_64), Linux

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OBS Studio | 30+ | `libobs` + `obs-frontend-api` |
| CMake | 3.16+ | Build system |
| Qt | 6.x | Core + Network + Widgets |
| FFmpeg | Runtime executable | Required for auto ISO recording. Must be on `PATH` or supplied via `ffmpeg_path`. |
| Zoom Meeting SDK | **5.17.x / 7.x** | Source builds only: place in `third_party/zoom-sdk/`. Official Windows release downloads bundle the runtime files needed by end users. |
| C++ compiler | C++17 | MSVC 2022 / Clang 14+ / GCC 11+ |
| Zoom Developer Account | - | Marketplace app with Public Client OAuth + PKCE and Meeting SDK / Embed enabled for the same environment. |

## Quick Start

1. **For source builds, get the Zoom SDK** - download from the [Zoom Developer Portal](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/releases/) and place it at `third_party/zoom-sdk/`. CMake auto-detects x64/arm64/x86 sub-layouts on Windows. End users installing an official Windows release do not need to download or provide SDK files.

2. **Configure & build**
   ```sh
   cmake -B build \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DZOOM_SDK_DIR=third_party/zoom-sdk \
     -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/obs-studio;/path/to/Qt6"

   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```

   On Windows, run CMake from a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell or use an
   explicit Visual Studio generator:
   ```powershell
   cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
     -DZOOM_SDK_DIR=third_party/zoom-sdk `
     -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/path/to/obs-studio-build;C:/path/to/Qt/6.x/msvc2022_64"

   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```

   To validate the Zoom SDK helper process before wiring up OBS and Qt, build
   only the engine:
   ```powershell
   cmake -S . -B build-engine -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
     -DCOREVIDEO_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF `
     -DZOOM_SDK_DIR=third_party/zoom-sdk

   cmake --build build-engine --config Release --target ZoomObsEngine
   ```

   If MSBuild reports `Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'Path'
   Key being added: 'PATH'`, normalize the process environment before running
   CMake from PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item Env:PATH -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   $env:Path = "C:\Program Files\CMake\bin;C:\Windows\System32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0"
   ```

   A normal OBS installation under `C:\Program Files\obs-studio` contains the
   runtime binaries, not the development CMake packages. For the full plugin
   build, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` must include an OBS build/install tree that
   contains `LibObsConfig.cmake` and `obs-frontend-apiConfig.cmake`, plus a
   matching Qt 6 MSVC package.

   Windows builds must ship Qt's TLS backend plugins (`obs-plugins/64bit/plugins/tls/`)
   for OAuth HTTPS requests to succeed.

3. **Install into OBS**
   ```sh
   cmake --install build --prefix "/path/to/obs-studio"
   ```

4. **Configure local settings** - published builds already contain the CoreVideo broker URL and do not require end users to enter Zoom app credentials. Open OBS -> **Tools -> Zoom Plugin Settings** to sign in with Zoom, configure the local control-server token/ports, and manage reconnect behavior. Developer-only builds can still use local credential overrides when the embedded broker identity is blank.

### Windows release packaging

GitHub Actions can validate the Windows build without the restricted Zoom
runtime, but public client releases must include `ZoomObsEngine.exe`,
`zoom-runtime\sdk.dll`, Qt TLS plugins, and the other bundled runtime files. If
`ZOOM_SDK_WINDOWS_URL` is not configured as a GitHub repository secret, CI skips
publishing a GitHub Release instead of shipping an incomplete package.

For fast local releases from a machine that already has the Zoom runtime, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\release-local.ps1 -Version v0.1.6 -Upload
```

When NSIS is installed, the release script also creates and uploads
`CoreVideo-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`. This is the recommended end-user installer: it
verifies the staged plugin/runtime files, detects a standard OBS Studio install
path, requires OBS to be closed, installs the files, verifies the installed
runtime, and registers an uninstaller in Windows Apps & Features. The ZIP
remains available for manual or advanced installs. Pass `-SkipInstaller` if you
only want the ZIP package.

If an FFmpeg shared development tree exists at `C:\ffmpeg`, local releases
automatically enable hardware I420->NV12 conversion and bundle the FFmpeg DLLs
beside the OBS plugin. Pass `-DisableFfmpegHwAccel` to force a CPU-only build.

Useful options:

```powershell
.\scripts\release-local.ps1 -Version v0.1.6 -Install -ObsInstallPath "C:\Program Files\obs-studio"
.\scripts\release-local.ps1 -Version v0.1.6 -BuildPath build-nmake -Upload
```

The script builds, installs into a staging folder, verifies the plugin, OAuth
callback helper, Qt TLS backend, `ZoomObsEngine.exe`, and `zoom-runtime\sdk.dll`,
creates a ZIP under `dist/`, optionally creates the NSIS setup EXE, and
optionally uploads both assets to the matching GitHub Release.

### OBS scene smoke test

Use the OBS smoke test when validating plugin-created OBS scene graph behavior
on a machine with OBS running and obs-websocket enabled. It does not exercise
the optional Sidecar UI. The script connects directly to obs-websocket v5,
creates a deterministic CoreVideo test scene, links
participant sources through nested slot scenes, switches OBS to the test scene,
and audits that the expected scenes, inputs, and scene items are present.

```powershell
.\scripts\obs-scene-smoke-test.ps1
```

If obs-websocket has a password, pass it explicitly or use the environment:

```powershell
$env:OBS_WEBSOCKET_PASSWORD = "your-websocket-password"
.\scripts\obs-scene-smoke-test.ps1 -ParticipantCount 8
```

To verify an already-created scene graph without creating or modifying sources:

```powershell
.\scripts\obs-scene-smoke-test.ps1 -AuditOnly -SceneName "CoreVideo Smoke Test"
```

5. **Set up OAuth (for Marketplace / external-account joins)** - publishers configure the Cloudflare broker and bake `-DZOOM_EMBED_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/start` into the build. End users just open the Settings dialog and click **Sign in with Zoom**. See [`docs/ZOOM_MARKETPLACE_OAUTH.md`](docs/ZOOM_MARKETPLACE_OAUTH.md) for the full walkthrough.

6. **Join once, then assign outputs** - use the CoreVideo dock or the TCP/OSC control APIs to join the meeting once per OBS session. Then add **Zoom Participant**, **Zoom Participant Audio**, **Zoom Share**, or **Zoom Interpretation Audio** sources and assign them to participants or dynamic roles.

## Zoom OAuth PKCE

CoreVideo uses user-level OAuth 2.0 with PKCE through the CoreVideo HTTPS broker for attributed meeting joins and Zoom App Marketplace compliance. Published builds do not ship OAuth or Meeting SDK secrets in the OBS plugin. The broker performs the Zoom token exchange with Public Client OAuth; the helper process authenticates the Meeting SDK with the same Marketplace Public Client ID as `AuthContext.publicAppKey`.

### Build-time configuration (publisher, one-time)
Pass the broker identity at CMake configure time:
```
cmake -B build \
  -DZOOM_EMBED_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=y6sIWSwiTZe1JygMx4C9EQ \
  -DZOOM_EMBED_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/start \
  -DZOOM_EMBED_MEETING_SDK_PUBLIC_APP_KEY=y6sIWSwiTZe1JygMx4C9EQ ...
```
These values are compiled into the plugin and used for every install of that build. There is no UI for entering production credentials, and embedded values override stale `global.ini` entries. Current production builds use the Public Client ID for OAuth and pass the same value to the Meeting SDK as `AuthContext.publicAppKey`.

### Flow
1. In **Tools -> Zoom Plugin Settings**, click **Authorize with Zoom** (no IDs to enter). The plugin registers the `corevideo://` URL scheme automatically on first use.
2. The browser opens at `https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/start`; the broker generates the PKCE verifier/challenge and redirects to Zoom.
3. Zoom redirects to `https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/callback`; the broker returns a short-lived broker token to `corevideo://oauth/callback`.
4. `CoreVideoOAuthCallback.exe` (Windows) or `CoreVideoOAuthCallback.app` (macOS) forwards the URL to the plugin via the TCP control server (`oauth_callback` command).
5. The plugin verifies state, redeems the broker token over HTTPS, and persists access + refresh tokens. On Windows, tokens are DPAPI-protected before storage.
6. Before each meeting join, CoreVideo refreshes the token if needed and fetches the signed-in user's ZAK. The Zoom helper process initializes the SDK with `AuthContext.publicAppKey` set to the embedded Public Client ID and `AuthContext.jwt_token` set to null, then joins with the ZAK.

See [`docs/ZOOM_MARKETPLACE_OAUTH.md`](docs/ZOOM_MARKETPLACE_OAUTH.md) for the full setup guide and security notes.

## Control APIs

### TCP JSON (port 19870)

```sh
# Meeting status
echo '{"cmd":"status"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# List participants with video/mute/talking state
echo '{"cmd":"list_participants"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Reassign source to participant at runtime
echo '{"cmd":"assign_output","source":"Zoom Participant 1","participant_id":123,"isolate_audio":true,"audio_channels":"stereo"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Forward OAuth callback URL from custom scheme helper
echo '{"cmd":"oauth_callback","url":"corevideo://oauth/callback?broker_token=...&state=..."}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870
```

Commands: `help`, `status`, `list_participants`, `list_outputs`, `assign_output`, `assign_output_ex`, `recover_stale_outputs`, `upgrade_low_quality_outputs`, `join`, `leave`, `oauth_callback`, `iso_recording_start`, `iso_recording_stop`, `iso_recording_status`, `speaker_director_status`, `speaker_director_configure`, `speaker_director_take`, `speaker_director_release`.

### Auto ISO Recording

Use **OBS -> Tools -> Zoom ISO Recorder** for the operator UI. The dock provides
an output-folder picker, FFmpeg path/test controls, CPU/GPU H.264 encoder
selection, a program-recording toggle, Start/Stop buttons, disk-space warnings,
and a live table of active ISO sessions and file paths. The recorder blocks
starts below 2 GB free, warns below 10 GB free, and surfaces FFmpeg process
errors in the session table and TCP/OSC status JSON.

```sh
# Start ISO recording. record_program=true also starts OBS program recording.
echo '{"cmd":"iso_recording_start","output_dir":"C:/Recordings/CoreVideo","ffmpeg_path":"ffmpeg","record_program":true}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Inspect active ISO sessions and output file paths.
echo '{"cmd":"iso_recording_status"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Stop ISO recording.
echo '{"cmd":"iso_recording_stop"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870
```

Each active source segment writes one `*.mp4` video file and one matching `*.wav` PCM audio file. A new segment starts when the resolved participant or source resolution changes.

### UDP OSC (port 19871)

| Address | Type tags | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `/zoom/status` | - | Reply: meeting state + active speaker |
| `/zoom/list_participants` | - | Reply: one `/zoom/participant` per user |
| `/zoom/list_outputs` | - | Reply: one `/zoom/output` per source |
| `/zoom/recover_stale_outputs` | `[,i]` | Retry stale video outputs; optional `1` forces cooldown bypass |
| `/zoom/upgrade_low_quality_outputs` | `[,i]` | Retry outputs below requested resolution; skips feeds already at 1080p |
| `/zoom/join` | `,sss` | meeting_id, passcode, display_name |
| `/zoom/leave` | - | Leave meeting |
| `/zoom/assign_output` | `,si[i]` | source, participant_id, [active_speaker] |
| `/zoom/assign_output/active_speaker` | `,s` | source |
| `/zoom/isolate_audio` | `,si` | source, 0\|1 |
| `/zoom/iso/start` | `[,s]` | optional output directory |
| `/zoom/iso/stop` | - | Stop ISO recording |

## Active Speaker Mode

CoreVideo has two active-speaker workflows:

- Set a normal **Zoom Participant** source to **Active Speaker** assignment mode when that source should follow the directed speaker.
- Add the dedicated **CoreVideo Active Speaker** source when you want a single speaker-follow OBS source. It uses a two-slot handoff internally: the current participant stays visible while the next participant warms on a hidden slot, then the source cuts only after a valid frame is available.

The **Active Speaker Director** in the Zoom Control dock decides which participant is directed. It tracks the raw Zoom speaker, candidate speaker, directed speaker, last directed speaker, and any manual supersede.

### Debounce

Two independent timers prevent rapid camera cuts:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sensitivity** (`speaker_sensitivity_ms`) | 500 ms | New speaker must hold the floor continuously for this long before the switch fires. A different speaker speaking resets the clock. |
| **Hold** (`speaker_hold_ms`) | 2 000 ms | After any switch, no further switch occurs for at least this long. |

The effective delay before each switch is `max(hold_remaining, sensitivity_remaining)`. If the delay is zero the switch fires immediately; otherwise a background thread sleeps for the delay and re-evaluates on the OBS UI thread.

### Safety

- **Liveness flag** - a `shared_ptr<atomic<bool>>` captured in every in-flight lambda ensures deferred callbacks bail safely if the source is destroyed before the timer fires.
- **Supersede logic** - a new candidate replaces the pending one, restarting the sensitivity clock. Stale callbacks silently discard themselves.
- **Final verification** - before committing a switch the code re-checks that the candidate is still the active speaker, so no switch fires for someone who stopped talking during the hold window.
- **UI-thread commitment** - all state mutations run on the OBS UI thread via `obs_queue_task`, preventing data races with the properties panel.

### Audio isolation interaction

When **Isolate Audio** is also enabled, every speaker switch sends an updated `subscribe` command to the engine with the new participant ID and `isolate_audio=true`, so the audio track always follows the same participant as the video.

### Director TCP controls

```sh
# Inspect directed/raw/candidate/last/manual speaker state.
echo '{"cmd":"speaker_director_status"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Update director timing.
echo '{"cmd":"speaker_director_configure","sensitivity_ms":650,"hold_ms":2500}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Manually take a participant until released.
echo '{"cmd":"speaker_director_take","participant_id":123456}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870

# Return to automatic speaker direction.
echo '{"cmd":"speaker_director_release"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 19870
```

## Output Profiles

Named profiles save the full source-to-participant mapping to JSON files under:

```
obs-studio/plugin_config/obs-zoom-plugin/profiles/<name>.json
```

Use the **Zoom Output Manager** dock, or **OBS -> Tools -> Zoom Output Manager** to focus it, to save, load, and delete profiles interactively. Profiles preserve assignment mode, requested resolution, channel mode, and audio role (`Mix`, `Isolated`, or `Audience`). Code can call `ZoomOutputProfile::save() / load() / list() / remove()` directly.
