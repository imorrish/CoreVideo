# Zoom Marketplace OAuth setup

CoreVideo uses the Zoom Meeting SDK public app key to initialize the Meeting SDK
helper and uses a user-level OAuth token to fetch a short-lived ZAK for
attributed joins. This is needed for external-account meetings and Marketplace
review.

Published builds use an HTTPS OAuth broker at `corevideo.iamfatness.us` with
Zoom Public Client OAuth + PKCE. The OBS plugin only knows the broker start URL
and the Meeting SDK public app key. End users never enter app credentials.

## Zoom Marketplace app (publisher, one-time)

1. Create a **General** app in the Zoom App Marketplace.
2. Enable **User-managed** OAuth.
3. Add this Redirect URL:
   `https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/callback`
4. Add the same value to the OAuth allow list:
   `https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/callback`
5. Add the minimum scopes used by the build:
   `user:read:token`
   `user:read:user`
6. Keep the Meeting SDK public app key configured for SDK authentication. OAuth
   credentials are separate from Meeting SDK credentials.

## Broker configuration

The Cloudflare Worker serving `corevideo.iamfatness.us` must have these secrets:

```
ZOOM_OAUTH_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=<Marketplace Public Client ID>
ZOOM_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://marketplace.zoom.us/v2/authorize
ZOOM_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/callback
ZOOM_OAUTH_SCOPES=user:read:token user:read:user
COREVIDEO_OAUTH_BROKER_SECRET=<random 32+ byte secret>
```

## Embedding the app identity into the build (publisher)

The OAuth broker URL and Meeting SDK public app key are part of the published
app's identity, not per-user settings. CoreVideo bakes them in at compile time:

```
cmake -B build \
  -DZOOM_EMBED_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/start \
  -DZOOM_EMBED_MEETING_SDK_PUBLIC_APP_KEY=<your_meeting_sdk_public_app_key> ...
```

In CI, pass the values as GitHub Actions secrets so they never land in the
source tree. They are written into `src/zoom-credentials.h` from
`src/zoom-credentials.h.in` and read by `ZoomPluginSettings::load()`.

When embedded values are present, they win over OBS `global.ini` so a stale
local config cannot change the published app identity. Developers can still use
`global.ini` overrides only in local builds where the embedded values are blank.

## End-user sign-in

1. Install a CoreVideo build that has the app identity embedded.
2. Open OBS, then open **Tools > Zoom Plugin Settings**.
3. In the **Zoom Account** section click **Sign in with Zoom** and approve the
   app in the browser. There are no Client ID, Client Secret, or Authorization
   URL fields to configure; the build already knows the broker URL.
4. The callback helper (`CoreVideoOAuthCallback.exe` on Windows,
   `CoreVideoOAuthCallback.app` on macOS) is registered for the `corevideo://`
   URL scheme the first time you click Sign in and forwards the redirect to the
   running plugin on `127.0.0.1:<ControlServerPort>` (default `19870`).

## Runtime flow

1. CoreVideo opens the system browser at the embedded broker start URL with a
   local `state` and `return_uri=corevideo://oauth/callback`.
2. The broker generates a PKCE verifier/challenge and redirects to
   `https://marketplace.zoom.us/v2/authorize` with
   `redirect_uri=https://corevideo.iamfatness.us/oauth/callback`.
3. Zoom redirects back to the broker.
4. The broker returns an encrypted, short-lived broker token containing the
   authorization code to `corevideo://oauth/callback`.
5. The callback helper forwards that URL to the running plugin. The plugin
   verifies `state`, redeems the broker token over HTTPS, and the broker
   exchanges the code for access/refresh tokens using Public Client OAuth:
   `client_id` and `code_verifier` in the form body, with no client secret and
   no Authorization header.
6. Before joining a meeting, the plugin refreshes the access token through the
   broker if needed and calls
   `GET https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/token?type=zak`.
7. The returned ZAK is passed into the Meeting SDK `JoinParam4WithoutLogin` as
   `userZAK`.

## Security notes

- No client secret is required for OAuth or shipped in the binary. The settings
  dialog does not expose Client ID, Client Secret, or Authorization URL fields,
  so users cannot misconfigure the integration.
- Broker state is HMAC-signed and expires after 10 minutes. Broker result
  tokens are AES-GCM encrypted, contain only the authorization code, and expire
  after 5 minutes.
- Windows token storage uses DPAPI before writing tokens into OBS global config.
- Refresh tokens are rotated; always persist the latest refresh token Zoom
  returns.
- Windows builds must ship Qt's TLS backend plugins, especially the Schannel
  backend under `obs-plugins/64bit/plugins/tls`, or OAuth HTTPS requests will
  fail before tokens or ZAKs can be fetched.
- The URL callback command bypasses the local control-server token, but the
  OAuth `state` is still required before any broker token can be redeemed.
- Do not log access tokens, refresh tokens, ZAKs, authorization codes, broker
  tokens, or OAuth state values.

## Marketplace review checklist

- Explain that CoreVideo joins meetings as an OBS capture/ISO recording tool.
- Request only the scopes used by the build.
- Provide test credentials and a test meeting hosted outside the app account.
- Document the visible in-product OAuth sign-in and uninstall/disconnect path.
- Make sure the Marketplace listing explains when meeting audio/video is
  captured, where it is processed, and that raw media stays local unless OBS
  outputs it.
